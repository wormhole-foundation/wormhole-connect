Wormhole Connect is a customizable React widget for cross-chain asset transfers powered by Wormhole.

[![Wormhole Connect running on Portal Bridge](https://i.imgur.com/sZJKw8e.png)](https://portalbridge.com/)

Connect is powered by the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts). Developers interested in building their
own interface for Wormhole bridging functionality are encouraged to explore the SDK!

## Demo

Wormhole Connect is deployed live in several production apps. Here are a few:

- [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com/)
- [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/bridge/wormhole)
- [PancakeSwap](https://bridge.pancakeswap.finance/wormhole)


## Getting Started 

### Via NPM for React apps (Recommended)

If you're using React, you can import the `<WormholeConnect />` component directly into your JSX:

#### Installation

```bash
npm i @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect
```

#### Using the component

```javascript
import WormholeConnect from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeConnect />
  );
}
```

### Alternative: hosted version via CDN (for any website)

If you're not using React, you can still embed Connect on your website by using the hosted version:

```ts
import {
  wormholeConnectHosted,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const container = document.getElementById('connect')!;

wormholeConnectHosted(container);
```


You can provide `config` and `theme` parameters in a second function argument:

```ts
import {
  wormholeConnectHosted,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const container = document.getElementById('connect')!;

wormholeConnectHosted(container, {
  config: {
    rpcs: {
      ...
    }
  },
  theme: {
    background: {
      default: '#004547',
    }
  }
});
```

## Configuration

Wormhole Connect is highly customizable via two props: `config` and `theme`. Here is an example which
limits it to two chains and customizes the background color:

```tsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig, WormholeConnectPartialTheme
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Solana']
};

const theme: WormholeConnectPartialTheme = {
  background: {
    default: '#212b4a'
  }
};

function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeConnect config={config} theme={theme} />
  )
}
```

If using the hosted version, provide `config` and `theme` as JSON-serialized strings on the mount point:

```html
<div id="wormhole-connect" data-config="{...}" data-theme="{...}"></div>
```

Below are some of the more commonly used config options. See
[the full Connect docs](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/wormhole-connect/overview) for more complete
documentation and examples of the different config options.

### Network (`network`):

Values: `Mainnet` | `Testnet` | `Devnet`

Connect renders in Mainnet mode by default, but you can switch it to testnet by setting `network` to `Testnet`:

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  network: 'Testnet'
}
```

### Choosing Chains (`chains`):

You can provide a whitelist of chains to limit which ones Connect offers.

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Solana']
}
```

See [`chains.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/base/src/constants/chains.ts) in the SDK. By default, Connect offers its full built-in list for both `mainnet` and `testnet`:

| `mainnet` | `testnet` |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Ethereum | Sepolia |
| Polygon | |
| Bsc | Bsc |
| Avalanche | Avalanche |
| Celo | Celo |
| Moonbeam | Moonbeam |
| Solana | Solana |
| Sui | Sui |
| Aptos | Aptos |
| Base | BaseSepolia |
| Osmosis | Osmosis |
| Evmos | Evmos |
| Kujira | Kujira |
| Injective | Injective |
| Kaia | Kaia |
| Arbitrum | ArbitrumSepolia |
| Optimism | OptimismSepolia |
| Scroll | Scroll |
| Blast | Blast |
| Xlayer | Xlayer |
| Mantle | Mantle |

> Osmosis support is in beta, reach out to a Wormhole contributor for early access.

### RPC Endpoints (`rpcs`):

We strongly recommend that you configure your own custom RPC endpoints for each network your application needs. The default public RPCs may be throttled or rate limited.

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  rpcs: {
    Solana: 'https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
    Ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  }
}
```

### Custom Tokens (`tokensConfig`)

You can add arbitrary tokens to the Connect tokens menu by providing a `tokensConfig` key.

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  tokensConfig: {
    ...
  }
}
```

See the "Arbitrary Token" example in [the config docs](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/wormhole-connect/configuration#arbitrary-token).

Please note you have to [register a token](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/#/register) with the token bridge before you can use it in Connect.

### Configuring Custom NTT (Native Token Transfer) Tokens

To configure a custom NTT token, pass your NTT config to the `nttRoutes` helper function, which will add the NTT routes to the `routes` array. You can find the definition for the NTT config [here](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/6a1a3d9e6d1a2045fb1688c2b53c9ac145cb40bc/sdk/route/src/types.ts#L34).

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  routes: [
    ...nttRoutes({
      tokens: {
        // Your custom NTT configs go here
        // See: https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/9548507ca68dfd249bf84057889dc61553b17b5f/wormhole-connect/src/components/DemoApp/consts.ts#L3 for an example NTT config
      }
    })
    // other routes
  ]
}
```

Each `token` address specified in the NTT config must have a corresponding entry in `tokensConfig`, whether it is a built-in or custom token.

### Custom Theme

You can also customize Connect's color scheme by providing a `WormholeConnectTheme` as the `theme` prop.
By default, Connect renders using the `dark` theme.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  dark,
  WormholeConnectTheme,
} from "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect";

// alters the `dark` theme
const customized: WormholeConnectTheme = dark;
customized.success = '#212b4a';
customized.background.default = "navy";
customized.button.action = "#81c784";
customized.button.actionText = "#000000";

export default function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect theme={customized} />;
}
```

You can change the `theme` prop to dynamically change Connect's colors, for example when your application
switches from light to dark mode.

See the definitions of `WormholeConnectTheme` and `dark` in [theme.ts](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/theme.ts) for type definitions.
