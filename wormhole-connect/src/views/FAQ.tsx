    title: 'What is Wormhole Connect',
    content: <>Wormhole Connect is an open source frontend SDK that lets Web3 developers embed asset bridging directly into their apps or websites. </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What types of assets does Connect support?',
    content: <>Initially, Connect will only support bridging wrapped assets. This means that any native token bridged through Connect and the underlying Wormhole Token Bridge will be received as a Wormhole-wrapped token on the destination chain.  In some cases, Wormhole minted tokens are the canonical representation on the chain (e.g. WETH on Solana is a Wormhole minted token, see https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-token-list) and in other cases Wormhole minted tokens can be swapped on the destination chainâ€™s DEX(s) for whatever assets you need (e.g. USDCeth bridged from Ethereum to Avalanche can be swapped for native USDC on Trader Joe).</>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Will Connect support native asset bridging? ',
    content: <>Yes, Connect will soon surface multiple Wormhole-powered services (e.g. cross chain asset swaps) that enable other forms of bridging more suitable for certain use cases. Check https://wormhole.com/connect/ for updates on Connect support.</>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What chains and assets does Connect support?',
    content: <>Initially, Connect supports wrapped asset bridging of ETH, WETH, USDC, MATIC, WMATIC, BNB, WBNB, AVAX, WAVAX, FTM, WFTM, CELO, GLMR, WGLRM, AND SOL across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Celo, Moonbeam, Solana and Sui. Connect will support other Wormhole-connected chains and assets in the future, see the full list of Connect supported chains at https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/mainnet.ts and Wormhole supported chains at https://wormhole.com/network/. </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What is automatic relaying?',
    content: <>On EVM-based chains, Connect lets users bridge assets while only having to pay gas on the source chain. The automatic relaying feature pays gas on behalf of users on the destination chain. Connect will support automatic relaying for other chains in the future.</>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What is gas dropoff?',
    content: <>Gas dropoff is a Connect feature that enables users to pay an additional fee on the source chain to request a small amount of native gas on the destination chain. For example, a user bridging USDC from Ethereum to Sui can pay a fee denominated in USDC from their sending wallet to receive some native SUI in their receiving wallet in addition to the USDC they are bridging over. Gas dropoff is currently supported on EVM-based chains and Sui, and will be supported on other chains in the future.</>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What is automatic relaying?',
    content: <>Connect supports both light and dark modes and can optionally be fully customized. See the NPM package readme for more details on how to fully customize the UI (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect). </>,
