  /**
   * When sending an IBC transfer from a chain A to B, the following happens:
   *  i. A transaction is executed on blockchain A which emmits a send_packet and an ibc_transfer event,
   * the former contains the ibc packet information, while the later holds the denom/amount to transfer
   *  ii. The relayer picks up the packet and delivers it to B through a transaction, which emmits 3 events:
   * recv_packet, fungible_token_packet, and write_acknowledgement. The ACK event means that the packet was
   * processed succesfully, which in this case means the funds arrived to the address on B
   *  iii. The relayer then sends a transaction on A to acknowledge the packet, which emmits an
   * acknowledge_packet event which has the same data as the original send_packet event
   *
   * For cosmos to cosmos transfers, the chain is A->Wormchain->B, each of these interactions follows the
   * procedure described above. However, Wormchain acts a "packet forwarder", so instead of writing the ACK
   * to A as soon as it receives the first transfer, it will hold that ACK until it's received the ACK of the
   * transfer to B. This means that the tx on wormchain which receives the packet from A won't emit the ACK event;
   * this will be done at a later transaction when the relayer has confirmed that the tx from wormchain to B has
   * processed succesfully, emitting two events: a write_acknowledgement for the Wormchain->B transfer, followed by
   * a write_acknowledgement for the A->Wormchain transfer. It is after this second tx on wormchain that the relayer
   * delivers the ack back to A.
   *
   * So, the process to get the transaction on B which receives the funds will be the following:
   *  i. Extract the first ibc transfer packet information from the tx on A by scanning the send_packet event
   *  ii. Look for the write_acknowledgement transaction on wormchain
   *  iii. From that same transaction, extract the Wormchain->B ibc packet information present in the acknowledge_packet
   * event.
   *  iv. Now that we have the ibc packet info for Wormchain->B, search for the write_acknowledgement on the destination chain
